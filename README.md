# `My Gallery` â€” Offline first image gallery, in sync thx to pouchdb/couchdb

`npm install -g pouchdb-server`

Electron packager (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)

# Configuration
Once PouchDB server is running, connect using root (`root/root`) account, and create `images` database.
